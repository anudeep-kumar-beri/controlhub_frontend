# Balance Sheet & Financial Reports Guide

## What is a Balance Sheet?

A **Balance Sheet** is a financial snapshot showing what you own (assets), what you owe (liabilities), and what's left over (equity) at a specific point in time.

### The Golden Equation:
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```
or
```
Net Worth (Equity) = Assets - Liabilities
```

## Components Explained

### 🏦 ASSETS (What You Own)
Things that have value and can generate income:

1. **Investments**
   - Fixed Deposits (FDs)
   - Mutual Funds (MFs)
   - Stocks, Bonds, Cryptocurrency
   - Gold
   - Real Estate

2. **Cash & Bank Accounts**
   - Savings accounts
   - Current accounts
   - Cash on hand

**Total Assets** = Sum of all investments + cash/bank balances

---

### 💳 LIABILITIES (What You Owe)
Money you need to pay back:

1. **Outstanding Loans**
   - Personal loans
   - Home loans
   - Car loans
   - Credit card debt
   - Education loans

2. **Pending Expenses**
   - Bills due but not paid
   - Rent pending
   - Any unpaid obligations

**Total Liabilities** = Sum of all loans + pending payments

---

### 💰 EQUITY (Your Net Worth)
What's truly yours after paying all debts:

```
Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
```

**Positive Net Worth** = You own more than you owe ✅
**Negative Net Worth** = You owe more than you own ⚠️

## Other Financial Reports

### 📊 Income Statement (Profit & Loss)
Shows your financial performance over a period:

- **Revenue/Income**: Money you earned (salary, investments, side income)
- **Expenses**: Money you spent (rent, food, bills, entertainment)
- **Net Income**: Revenue - Expenses

```
Net Income = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
```

**Positive Net Income** = Profit (you earned more than you spent) ✅
**Negative Net Income** = Loss (you spent more than you earned) ⚠️

---

### 💵 Cash Flow Statement
Tracks how money moves in and out:

1. **Operating Activities**
   - Day-to-day income and expenses
   - Salary, bills, shopping

2. **Investing Activities**
   - Buying/selling investments
   - FD deposits, mutual fund investments

3. **Financing Activities**
   - Loans taken or repaid
   - Debt payments

```
Net Cash Flow = Operating + Investing + Financing
```

**Positive Cash Flow** = More money came in than went out ✅
**Negative Cash Flow** = More money went out than came in ⚠️
